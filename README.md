# ObesityResearchNE
 Analysis of correlations between obesity, mortality, and comorbilities. You only really need to know about/care about 4 files/folders

## final_code.ipynb 
To run, make sure to first install all relevant imports (will add a list/dockerfile later, for now all you need are the imports listed at the top of final_code), then just run all of the cells in final_code.ipynb. If using VSCode, all you should need to do is go to the final_code.ipynb file and hit the "Run all" button (top center). All of my code contains comments explaining everything, but if you are confused by something then please notify me.
 
## testing_notebook.ipynb
Contains EDA/early code that I used to better understand the data. I later moved all of the important code to final_code.py

## Visualizations_and_Tables
All of the figures and tables I created in final_code.ipynb are also contained in this folder (in .png form for the heatmaps, .csv for everything else).
